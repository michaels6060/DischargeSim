This folder contains the input data format for `ScenarioLoaderMIMICIV`. Scenario loader format can be adapted for other data sources. `OSCE-format.jsonl` can be made such that agent only receives a clinical note to process.

Because this is MIMIC-IV data, only credentialed users can contact us to obtain the complete original-notes.txt data. (https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/)
